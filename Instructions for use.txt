***************************************************************************************************************************
*It is advised to use the Arogya Setu app for slot booking, as the data on the website www.cowin.gov.in is not updated in realtime, there is a delay of 3 or 4 minutes whereas 
the data on Arogya Setu is updated in realtime.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First things first: pre requisites for getting notifications on mobile
i) Download PushBullet from Play Store
ii) Make an account and allow permissions (Notification Access is required)
iii) Open browser and go to pushbullet.com and log in with the same account
iv) Make sure that your device name is showing up in the devices (the button with phone icon) tab on the website
v) Go to settings (the button with cogwheel icon) on the website and click on Account
vi) Under Access Tokens, click on Create Access Token and copy the code that appears below it
vii) Paste the code in the api_key field in data.txt present in Vaccine Slot Notifier folder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing notification:
Run the Notification Test.exe to see if notifications are being received on the phone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the program:
*To run the program, just open Vaccine Slot Notifier.exe. No window will open when you run it, it runs in the background. However you will receive a notification on your phone stating 
that the program is running.
*Make sure that the computer and mobile are connected to the internet at all times and that the computer doesn't sleep.
*To close it, open Task manager and end task for Vaccine Slot Notifier.exe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: There will be no activity until slots are found, it will just run in the background. Once slots are found, notifications will arrive on the phone till the vaccines available 
become zero. And there will be a lot of notifications in a short span of time. So make sure to stop the program from the task manager once you've booked the slot and/or 
uninstall PushBullet app.

In case of any error message, make sure that you have entered the details in data.txt correctly.

You may see that the website cowin.gov.in or Arogya Setu app shows available vaccine even though this program sends no notification, this is because the website and app show total 
count of dose 1 and dose 2 vaccines, whereas this program send notification only when the specified dose has vaccines available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now open data.txt and change the entries according to your preferences and save the file.
(See sample_data_1.txt and sample_data_2.txt for examples.)
